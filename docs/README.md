# Documentation Assets

This directory contains assets used in the project documentation, such as:

## Guidelines for Images

- Keep images reasonably sized (both in dimensions and file size)
- Use descriptive filenames
- Prefer PNG format for screenshots and diagrams
- Compress images when possible to reduce repository size
